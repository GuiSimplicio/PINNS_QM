# PINNS_QM
Using PINNs to solve the Schrödinger Equation. This code was developed while attending the course "Integrated Project in Engineering Physics", at Instituto Superior Técnico, during the academic year of 22/23.

The file ist93076_Guilherme_Simplicio_report.pdf contains the manuscript delivered for this course.

On the file PINNS_QM_task1.ipynb you can find the solution of the 1D Schrödinger Equation and the 3D Schrödinger Equation using Bohr's potential.

On the file PINNS_QM_task2.ipynb you can find the computation of the energy of the particle for the 1D Schrödinger Equation and the comparison with a traditional method of fitting.

On the files PINNS_QM_task1_CUDA.ipynb and PINNS_QM_task2_CUDA.ipynb, you can find a more refined and mature version of the code, while also supporting GPU computation.
