# PINNS_QM
Using PINNs to solve the Schrödinger Equation.

On the file PINNS_QM_task1.ipynb you can find the solution of the 1D Schrödinger Equation and the 3D Schrödinger Equation using Bohr's potential.

On the file PINNS_QM_task2.ipynb you can find the computation of the energy of the particle for the 1D Schrödinger Equation and the comparison with a traditional method of fiitting.
